# Modern-Compiler-Design
Programs transcribed and modified from the text Modern Compiler Design by Grune

## Why does this exist?
As part of my education in compiler engineering, I am working my way through the above text, and transcribing the code contained therein. Doing this, I hope to accomplish 3 goals:
* Refresh my knowledge of C programming styles and conventions. I have experience with C, and to a larger extent, C++, but given that these are often the defacto languages for compiler engineering, I will refamiliarize myself with the language and also the practical aspects of compiling and organizing the code itself.
* Expand the truncated programming style in the book. Easier to read this way.
* Complete the ideas presented in the chapters, by way of exercises left to the reader, or unimplemented functions due to space constraints.
