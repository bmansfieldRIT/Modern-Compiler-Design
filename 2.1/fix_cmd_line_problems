To solve any problems with command line tools or commands:

first:
    $ xcode-select --install
May fix some issues, because xcode is in charge of many pre-installed
instances of language version/toolchains

Next:
    $ brew update
    $ brew upgrade
First one updates homebrew, the next cmd updates each tool/language/toolchain 
currently maintained by brew
